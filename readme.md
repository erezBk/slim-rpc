# slim-rpc
this project is my RPC implementation.
I was very inspired by the [trpc](https://github.com/trpc/trpc) lib and they way that it made
developing fullstack apps with such a good DX.
but when I was inspecting the code I was blown away by the amount of it :)
So I decided to create my own lib so that I can easily understand  what's going on
and to learn from the experience...

I'm using it for my projects and U can too.
It just works and there is so little code, it's slim :)

enjoy :partying_face:
