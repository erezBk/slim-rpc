# slim-rpc
this project is my RPC implementation.<br>
I was very inspired by [trpc](https://github.com/trpc/trpc) lib and the way that it made
developing fullstack apps with such a good DX.<br>
but when I was inspecting the code I was blown away by the amount of it :)<br>
So I decided to create my own lib so that I can easily understand  what's going on<br>
and to learn from the experience...

I'm using it for my projects and U can too. <br>
It just works and there is so little code<br>
it's **under 250 lines of code!**
It's slim :)

the library comes with adapters for express, koa & fastify <br>
but you can also create an adapter of your own by implementing **WebFramework** <br>
take a look at the other adapters to understand what you need to do..it's very simple.

enjoy using :partying_face:
